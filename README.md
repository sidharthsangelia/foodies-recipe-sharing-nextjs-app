# 🍲 Foodies - Recipe Sharing App

This is a full-stack recipe sharing app built using **Next.js (App Router)**. It allows users to add, view, and explore meal recipes with images and instructions. This project helped me understand real-world development with Next.js, dynamic routing, form handling, and file uploads.

## 🚀 Features

- View a list of all recipes (meals)
- Detailed recipe page with image, title, summary, and step-by-step instructions
- Add new meals through a form (with file upload)
- Server-side rendering and static generation with dynamic routes
- Styling with CSS Modules
- Image optimization using `next/image`
- Backend handled using API routes

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 📌 Next.js Concepts
- **App Router**: Routing using the new `app/` directory instead of the older `pages/` directory.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Used dynamic route segments like `[mealSlug]` to fetch and render individual meal pages.
- **API Routes**: Created custom API endpoints for handling form submissions and file uploads.
- **Image Optimization**: Used the `next/image` component for better performance and responsive images.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Learned how to pre-render pages using `getStaticProps` and `generateStaticParams`.

### 📝 Form Handling
- Learned how to handle multipart form submissions using FormData.
- Managed validation and form submission state.

### 📁 File Uploads
- Faced challenges with uploading files via API routes in Next.js App Router.
- Understood how to parse `multipart/form-data` using third-party libraries (like `formidable` or `multer`) and how Vercel handles them in serverless environments.

### 💅 Styling
- Used **CSS Modules** for scoped styling per component.
- Built responsive layouts for better UI on desktop and mobile.

### ⚠️ Error Handling & Debugging
- Faced and fixed:
  - `500 Internal Server Error` during file uploads.
  - JSON parsing issues when API didn’t return expected output.
  - Sentry errors and console logs caused by browser extensions.
- Learned to use `try/catch` blocks in both client and server to gracefully handle errors and display helpful messages.
